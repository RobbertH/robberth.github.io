<h2>{{post.title}}</h2>
In the future, deepfakes will get cheaper and thus more ubiquitous.
To be able to tell the difference between a deepfake and real recorded footage, a tamper-proof digital signature hardware module could be added to or even embedded in the sensor of a camera.
Afterwards, every picture or video comes with a digital signature that can be verified with the public key of the device.
