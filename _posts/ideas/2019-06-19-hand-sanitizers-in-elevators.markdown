<h2>{{post.title}}</h2>
Three observations:
* Everybody is just waiting inside an elevator.
* Taking an elevator is likely one of the first and one of the last things people do in the building.
* Especially in tall buildings, everyone takes the elevator.

So, if you put a hand sanitizer in the elevator, you've got a good chance people will use it.
The same reasoning goes for just outside the elevator, where you're waiting for the elevator to arrive.
I think it's a very natural place for water-free hand sanitizers.
