Sometimes, when you sit in the shadow, or it's late in the evening, you wish your sunglasses were a little brighter.
Or when the sun really shines, you wish it'd block more light.
The solution is pretty easy: you can put two polarized filters in front of each other, and twist one of them in order to modify the amount of light that passes through.
This can easily be integrated in a pair of sunglasses.
There can also be a gear in the middle to twist both filters at the same time, with a scrollwheel on the side of the frame.
