<h2>{{post.title}}</h2>
This idea is probably one of the more unrealistic ones, but I'll bring it out anyways.
It's is to fill hollow frames or any empty space in a product with helium, to make it lighter.
It's basically an idea stolen from the zeppelin, and applied to any product that needs to be light, from airplanes to formula 1 cars, or even action cameras.
The problem is that the volumes of these spaces that are to be filled with helium, are way too small to cause any noticable improvement.
If you find a useful application for this idea, I'd be excited to hear it!
