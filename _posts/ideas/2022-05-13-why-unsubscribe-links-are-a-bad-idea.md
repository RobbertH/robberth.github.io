When you want to keep your mailbox clean, one thing you can do is unsubscribe from marketing mails.
Usually, at the very bottom of a marketing email, there'll be a link that takes you to a webpage where you can confirm that you want to be removed from the mailing list.
If you get into this habit, you're training yourself to open unwanted emails, discard all email content, scroll to the bottom and click a link.
This is exactly how phishing mails want you to behave.
I haven't found a good solution, but I would suggest to just add email filters to redirect the sender's address to spam.
