<h2>{{post.title}}</h2>

Speech AI such as virtual assistants should be able to recognize not only the words spoken, but also the mood of the speaker.
A relatively easy implementation would be to deduct the mood of the speaker, just by looking at the loudness and the pitch of a voice.
The benefit of knowing the mood of the speaker, is to be able to adapt the "mood" of the responding AI as well.
If the human is calm, it makes sense to reply calmly.
If they're panicking, it might be useful to try to calm them down.
If they're whispering, it's probably best to reply softly, with not too much volume.
And so on.
