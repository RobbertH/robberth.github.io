<h2>{{post.title}}</h2>
Here's a problem rather than an idea: landlords have no incentive to place solar panels on the places they rent out.
The energy they produce would reduce the bill of the tenant, not theirs.
They could ask higher rent, but it is hard for tenants to predict whether that's a good deal or not, (especially if they haven't lived there before) amongst others due to fluctuating energy prices.

One idea is to allow landlords to sell the electricity they produce directly to the tenant, in a deal with the external electricity provider.
