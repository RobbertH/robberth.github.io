<h2>Background & Concept</h2>
A friend of mine told me about a cool framework for building cross-platform apps 
called [Flutter](https://flutter.io), written in Dart. So far I do like it, you can
make very cool things very fast. I also really like cryptography, so I decided to combine 
both and build a secure application to keep text notes. It doesn't involve a lot of crypto itself,
it's mostly using packages, but some background knowledge on crypto does help to  
make design choices (e.g. salting password hashes). 

<h2>Code</h2>
The code can be found on this [Github repo](https://github.com/RobbertH/secureNotesApp).
