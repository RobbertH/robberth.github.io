<h2>Background</h2>
I was bored during summer vacations, so I decided to do my first DIY project, together with a good friend of mine.
I went ahead and bought a road bike. I was able to get my hands on an old one for just
€50. I wanted to color it almost entirely black with just a few fluoresecent yellow accents on it.
We even made a drawing before coloring it:<br>

So that was the idea, but when we went to the shop, the fluorescent yellow paint
turned out to be really expensive, so we decided to buy only one can. Of course, it was not sufficient,
so we ended up replacing the color for some light green, spending a total of another €50
on paint, lacquer and cleaning product. Eventually, we also made some design changes.

I guess the pictures tell the story better than I can:

<i>Our system of painting the wheels, but not the tires. This was necessary because for some reason, the tires were glued to the wheels. </i><br><br>

More than a year later, I got a bike to ride in Leuven to go to university, and
decided to enhance it a little bit too:
