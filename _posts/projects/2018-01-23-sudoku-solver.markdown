<h2>Background & Concept</h2>
I am starting to learn JavaScript, so I built a <a href="/public/sudoku/index.html"> sudoku solver</a>.
It uses the standard backtracking method.
I will host my JavaScript projects at <a href="/public/index.html"> this page</a>, because it gives me some more freedom with the page layout than this blog framework.
