<h2>Ideas</h2>
This section of my blog is not so much about finished projects, but rather about some ideas that popped into my mind.
Some of them might lead to a project, but for most of them, I don't have the time or resources to work on them, or they're just better implemented by someone with the necessary experience.
They are ideas that I used to keep in my personal notebook, but publishing them allows others to criticize them or to start a project of their own.
Above all, I hope for these ideas to be a source of inspiration.
