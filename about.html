			I'm Robbert. I like technology, swimming, music, (mathematic) riddles, and much more.
			I will mostly use this website for blogging about my
			projects, so anyone who's interested can read about what I spend my free time on.
			You can find my project posts on the <a href="/projects">projects page</a>.
