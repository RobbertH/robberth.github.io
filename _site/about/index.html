By now, you probably already have guessed my name. If not, look up at the
header of this website. Knowing that, I am basically a student with lots
of hobbies and interests. First of all, I have chosen to study engineering
at KU Leuven (which is great, by the way!) and as major and minor I chose
electronics and computer science respectively. Fortunately, that is also where my fields of
interest lay. I love tinkering around with my arduinos and that often goes hand
in hand with basic programming. Most of my love for
arduino started when I entered uni, and went to my first Soirée Pratique. That's
an event organised by IEEE's student branch Leuven, where older guys (masters and
doctorandi) gather to explain basic electronics to newbies (like me at the time).
There, I bought my first arduino and started tinkering at home. By now, my desk
is full of electronics and I have finished a couple of nice projects. I'm still learning
a lot, but all the work has started to pay off. Besides that, sometimes I leave my computer
for what it is and go running, biking or swimming. And I am also active in several
extracurricular groups, such as VTK Revue, Sagio.be and Humasol.
