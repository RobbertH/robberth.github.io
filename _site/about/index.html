By now, you probably already know my name. If not, look up at the
header of this website. Knowing that, I am basically a student with lots
of hobbies and interests. First of all, I have chosen to study engineering
at KU Leuven (which is great, by the way!) and as major and minor I chose
electronics and computer science respectively. Fortunately, that is also where my fields of
interest lay. I love tinkering around with my arduinos and that often goes hand
in hand with basic programming. Most of my love for
arduino started when I entered university, and went to my first Soir√©e Pratique. That's
an event organised by IEEE's student branch Leuven, where masters and
doctorandi gather to explain basic electronics to newbies (like me at the time).
There, I bought my first arduino and started tinkering at home. By now, my desk
is full of electronics and I have finished a couple of nice projects. I'm still learning
a lot, but all the work has started to pay off. Besides that, sometimes I leave my computer
for what it is and go running, biking or swimming. Lastly, I am also active in some 
extracurricular groups.
