	<h2> Welcome! </h2>
	<article>
		Hello! I am Robbert, an electronical engineering student @ KU Leuven.	
		I am basically a student with lots
		of hobbies and interests. First of all, I have chosen to study engineering
		at KU Leuven and as major and minor I chose
		electronics and computer science respectively. Fortunately, that is also where my fields of
		interest lay. I love tinkering around with my arduinos and that often goes hand
		in hand with basic programming. My love for
		arduino started when I entered university, and went to my first Soir√©e Pratique. That's
		an event organised by IEEE's student branch Leuven, where masters and
		doctorandi gather to explain basic electronics to newbies, like me at the time.
		I bought my first arduino there and started tinkering at home. By now, my desk
		is full of electronics and I have finished a couple of nice projects. I'm still learning
		a lot, but all the work has started to pay off. Besides that, sometimes I leave my computer
		for what it is and go running, biking or swimming. 
		I will mostly use this website for blogging about my
		projects, which you can find here: <a href="/projects">projects page</a>.
		Enjoy yourself!
